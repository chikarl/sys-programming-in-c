                The most basic method of accessing a file is via the <b>read()</b> and <b>write()</b> system calls.
                But before we open the file, it must be opened using an <b>open()</b> or <b>create()</b> system call.
                Once we are done with a file, it is the standard to always close it using the <b>close()</b> system call.

                <h3>The open() call</h3>
                <p>

                    With this, a file is opened and a file descriptoris obtained with the open() system call.
                    The open system call takes an argument <b>name</b> which is path of the file and maps the file descriptorto it, then returns that file descriptor on success. The file position is then set to 0 and the file is opened for access accordint to the flags given by the next argument <b>flag</b>
                </p>
                
                <h4>Flag Argument</h4>
                <p>
                    The <b>flag</b> argument determines how the file will be opened - readonly, writeonly, etc.
                    This argument must be one of the following: 
                    <ul>
                        <li>O_RDONLY for read-only</li>
                        <li>O_WRONLY for write-only</li>
                        <li>O_RDWR for read-write</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Let us look at my simple example. Refer to <b>e1-file-io/opening-file.c</b> for the code.
                    
                    You notice here that I set the path first to a valid file in this directory which produced a file descriptor of 3 for that file.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The flags argument can be multiple, separated by <b>|</b> (bitwise OR) changing the behaviour of the open request.
                    
                    Other important flags include:
                    <ul>
                        <li>O_APPEND: Opens the file in append mode.</li>
                        <li>O_CREAT: Creates the file if it does not exist</li>
                        <li><b>Contributors to this repo can add more flags when they can.</b></li>
                        
                    </ul>
